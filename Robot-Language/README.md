# Robot-Language
Made up programming language for an imaginary robot.

### Project Description:
Assume that you are working in the software department of a company that builds robots. The hardware department constructs robots that can turn, move, grab/release objects, send/receive data to/from the master. The robot has also some sensors to perceive the environment. The sensors return floating point values. The robot can turn 1 degree, to left or right, at a time, and move ahead in steps of 1 mm. Your team is asked to design a Programming Language to program the robots constructed by the hardware department. People who purchase these robots may not be computer engineers; so it is important that the programming language is readable, writable and reliable.

The language has lex and yacc files for creating a lexical analysizer and a parser.

## Notes:
- This is not a compiler and cannot actually execute any code. However, it can analyse, parse and check the written code for compiler errors.
- This project was a 3-man group project for the CS315 - Programming Languages course.
- Lex, Yacc and Test files can be found in the repo as well as a report explaning the grammer and purpose of the language.
